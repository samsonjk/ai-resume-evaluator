"**Candidate Match:** Approximately 75%\n\n**Matching Areas:**\n\n* **Full-Stack Experience:** The resume clearly highlights experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, aligning with the full-stack requirement.  Experience with JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Node.js) and backend language (Python) is a strong plus.\n* **Database Familiarity:** Experience with MySQL and MongoDB directly addresses the JD's requirements. AWS DynamoDB is not mentioned in the resume.\n* **Mobile Development:**  Depending on the details provided in the resume regarding \"mobile applications,\" this could be a strong match.  More details are needed to assess the level of expertise here.\n* **API Development:** The resume explicitly mentions API development.\n* **Software Testing and Debugging:** While not explicitly stated, it's common for full-stack developers to have these skills. More details in the resume would strengthen the match.\n* **UI/UX Design:** The resume lists UI/UX design.\n\n\n**Missing Skills/Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* **AWS Serverless Expertise:** The JD specifically requires experience with AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway. This is a significant gap in the candidate's skillset.\n* **Web Server Experience:** The JD mentions Apache; this isn't mentioned on the resume. While not a critical skill, having experience with web servers is generally expected of a Full Stack Developer.\n* **Desktop Application Development:**  The level of experience in desktop application development isn't clear from the brief description provided.  More detail is needed for proper assessment.\n\n**Explanation of Score:**\n\nThe candidate possesses many of the core skills required for a Full Stack Developer role.  However, the lack of AWS serverless experience is a notable deficiency given its explicit mention in the JD.  More information on web server experience and desktop application development is needed for a more precise evaluation.  The 75% score reflects a good foundation with some key skills missing.\n"
